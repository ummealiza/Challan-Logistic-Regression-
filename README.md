# Challan-Logistic-Regression-
In this Logistic Regression model, I have used a Challan daatset in which I have done pre-processing, checked Mean Square Error and Coefficient of Determination. In addition to this, I have saved the trained model , then uploaded that model, then took input from user and predicted output from the loaded model.
